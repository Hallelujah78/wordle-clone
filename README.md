  <h1>What?</h1>
  </header>
  <p align="left">A Wordle clone in React, TypeScript, with Vite, tested with Cypress with a side order of framer-motion.<p>
  <h1>Why?</h1>
  <p align="left">I was looking for something easy(?) to build to practice using TypeScript. I also wanted a project that I could build in other frameworks (once I learn them! :grinning:). Threw framer-motion in there as I'd been meaning to try it out since discovering it. I also needed a project for my portfolio.</p>
  <p align="left">Ended up taking a deep dive on custom hooks towards the end of this project. The result of that is <a href="https://github.com/Hallelujah78/local-storage-hook">here</a>. It's just me working my way through the react-use useLocalStorage hook and dumping my thoughts into a repo.</p>

<h1 align="center">Could This Be Useful to You?</h1>
<p>There's an ISSUES.md file that is a brain dump of most of the issues I encountered working on this project. There's also a DEVNOTES.md file that is a kind of a plan, todo, brain dump of my process. Dubious usefulness all round.</p>
<h1 align="center">Getting Started</h1>
- Bootstrapped with Vite so:
  
  - clone it
  - `npm i`
  - `npm run dev`

<h1 align="center">Help!</h1>
<p>Feel free to contact me with questions!</p>

<h1 align="center">Contributors</h1>
<p>Just lil old me.</p>
<h1 align="center">Learnings</h1>
<p>If there's one thing I learned from this project it's that you should use more emojis in your README. Furthermore, the name Dumpster Fire Edition, or DFE for the cool kids, reflects how I felt about my code while I was writing it.</p>
